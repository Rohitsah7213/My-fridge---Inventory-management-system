Santa Fe Black Bean Burger (Vegan)///
black beans, oats, cumin, cayenne , garlic powder,  pink salt, chunky salsa, olive oil, cornmeal///
1 can (14 oz) organic black beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 cup oats (rolled or quick)
1/4 cup flax meal or flour of choice (see notes)
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon cayenne or chipotle powder
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon pink salt
1/4 cup chunky salsa or pico de gallo, give or take
1 tablespoon olive oil, for pan-frying
cornmeal, for dusting (I used coarse grind) (optional)///
Mash black beans:
In a medium-size bowl, mash black beans with a strong fork or use a potato masher, leaving some chunks for texture if you like.

Make patty mixture:
Add oats, flour, spices, salt, and salsa, mix again, feel free to use your hands if you like to. If the mixture is too wet, add more flax meal/flour to the mix, but really it should be ok. Taste for flavor.

Shape patties:
Divide the mixture and shape your patties into whatever size you like. I like to make 2 jumbo-sized burger patties, but you can make 3 – 4 smaller ones. Give a light dusting of cornmeal if you have it. It will give a nice crunch, flavor and cook up crispy.

Cook on the stovetop, oven, or grill.

Stovetop:
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet on medium. Cook for about 5 minutes on each side. It’s ok if the cornmeal gets a little crispy. Trust me, it’s delicious!
Oven (oil-free): Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment or a silicone mat. Place patties on a baking sheet, place in the oven on the center rack, and bake for 10 – 15 minutes, flip and repeat.

Serve with your choice of accompaniments such as red onion slices, leafy greens, salsa, or Vegan Mayo. Add some mashed avocado as a spread or sliced avocado if you prefer. Or serve on a bed of leafy greens.

RAW CHOCOLATE AVOCADO PUDDING (3 FLAVORS)///
avocado , banana, cacao powder, pure maple syrup, vanilla extract, cinnamon, orange juice, orange zest, espresso powder///
Chocolate Avocado Pudding Base

1 large avocado (or 2 small), skin and seed removed
1 ripe banana, peeled
3 – 4 tablespoons cacao powder
3 – 4 tablespoons pure maple syrup, coconut nectar or date syrup
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, optional

Orange Chocolate Avocado Pudding

1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice, + more as needed
1 teaspoon or so orange zest, optional

Chocolate Espresso Avocado Pudding

1 teaspoon instant espresso powder///

In a blender, combine the base pudding ingredients (along with any one of the optional flavor combinations) and blend until creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Add water, a few tablespoons at a time, as needed for desired consistency. Typically I use 1/2 cup of water, unless making the orange flavored. Taste for flavor and adjust accordingly.
Pudding can be served at room temp, but I find it’s best when chilled in the refrigerator for a couple hours.
Serve: Top with a dollop of whipped coconut cream and shaved dark chocolate, cacao nibs or carob chips.
Serves 2
Store: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 4 – 5 days. To freeze, store in popsicle molds for best results, can be kept in the freezer for up to 2 months.

VEGAN BURRITO BOWL///
olive oil, bell peppers, onion, dried oregano, mineral salt, black beans, Cilantro Lime Rice, romaine, Corn Salsa, Pico de Gallo, avocados, lime///
Fajitas

2 tablespoons olive oil or 1/4 cup water for water saute
2 bell peppers (any color), cored and thinly sliced
1 small white onion, thinly sliced
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
pinch of mineral salt///

The Beans:
Start with the beans, I usually make these ahead if making from scratch. If you’re making them fresh, the Instant Po Black Beans will take about 60 minutes to complete. If I don’t want to use homemade, open a can of black beans and simply drain and rinse them.

The Rice:
The Cilantro Lime Rice takes about 25 – 30 from start to finish so it’s a good idea to get that started after the beans, unless using canned beans than you can start with the rice.

The Veggies:
The fajitas only take about 15 minutes, including prep time, to finish. These can be made while the rice is cooking.

In a large skillet, heat olive oil or water over medium heat. Add the onions, bell peppers, oregano and pinch of salt, and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until onions and peppers are soft and tender. Remove from heat.

Assemble:
To assemble your burrito bowls, in individual bowls add about 3/4 cup of rice, 3/4 cup of beans, 1/4 – 1/3 cup of corn salsa or pico de gallo, and 1/4 of the fajita mixture, along with a handful of shredded lettuce. Add a side of avocado (mashed or sliced), I usually use 1/4 of an avocado per bowl. Top with a squeeze of lime, pinch of salt and a dash of red pepper flakes.

Store:
All the leftover components can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 – 4 days. Store individually or together (as for meal prep).

1 tablespoon water or 1/4 cup water for water saute
1 small onion, diced
1 small jalapeno, seeds removed and diced, optioanal
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt, to taste
2 cans (15oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
1/4 – 1/2 cup water or vegetable broth///

Black Beans: In a medium pot, warm oil over medium heat, add the onions and saute for 5 minutes. Add the jalapeno, cumin, oregano, garlic powder and pinch of salt, cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until nice and fragrant. Add the beans, and 1/4 cup of water, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 5 – 8 minutes. Remove from heat, smash at least 1/2 of the beans, using the back of a slotted spoon or fork. Add the remaining water as needed for desired consistency. If you add too much water, the beans will thicken upon standing. Taste for flavor adding more salt as needed.
Warm the tortillas: I love to warm my tortillas over a medium-low flame of the stovetop burner, flipping them often until they are lightly charred around the edges.
Assemble: Lay the tortilla on a flat surface, top with 1/4 cup of the beans, small handful of leafy greens, pico de gallo and/or corn salsa, sliced avocado, and crumbled cheese (optional). Add a sprinkle of salt and squeeze of lime overtop.
Makes about 10 tacos, 2 tacos per serving.
Store in the refrigerator or freezer: Keep leftover black beans in the refrigerator 4 – 5 days, stored in covered containers. For longer storage, keep in the freezer for 2 – 3 months in freezer safe containers. Let thaw before reheating.
To Reheat: Warm the beans on the stove over low, stirring occasionally, until warmed through. Alternately, place them in the microwave for 30 second intervals, stirring each time, until warmed.
NOTES:
These Instant Pot Black Beans made from scratch using dried beans would be great too!
For creaminess, try adding a dollop of Vegan Sour Cream or Sriracha Cashew Cream.

1 can (15oz) black eyed peas, drained and rinsed
1 can (15oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
1 can (14oz) corn, drained
2 red bell peppers, finely diced
1 jalapeno, finely diced (a few seeds are ok)
1/2 red onion, finely diced
1 large or 2 small avocados, diced
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
2 limes, juice of
3 – 4 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon chili powder
1/2 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
mineral salt & pepper to taste///

Dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, lime juice, olive oil, chili powder, cumin, garlic powder, ad generous pinch of salt. Set aside. (You can also just pour the ingredients over the assembled salad before tossing, as mentioned in the post, but mixing will help dissolve the spices.)
Prep: Drain and rinse the black eyes peas and black beans. Drain the canned corn, or if using fresh corn cut it off the cobb. Dice the red peppers, jalapeno, and onion. Chop the cilantro.
Avocado: The easiest and quickest way to dice an avocado for this recipe, is to slice it in half, remove the seed, using a knife, score the flesh in to segments, using a cross-hatch pattern, being careful to not break through the skin. Scoop it out using a large spoon, getting as close to the skin as possible, in one swoop.
Assemble: In a large bowl, add the beans, corn, bell pepper, jalapeno, onion, avocado and cilantro. Pour the dressing overtop and toss well to coat. Taste for flavor.
Eat right away, or let the salad rest in the refrigerator for a few hours to let the flavors mingle.
Leftovers will stay fresh for up to 4 – 5 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator. I don’t recommend freezing this salad/salad if adding avocado, if planning on freezing, omit the avocado and add it when serving. Freeze for up to 2 months.

1 package cauliflower rice (16 oz.) or 1 lb. cauliflower head
1 tablespoons rice vinegar
1 mango, sliced
1 avocado, sliced
1 cucumber, julienned
1/4 red cabbage, sliced///

Cauliflower Rice: If using a head of cauliflower, grate cauliflower using a handheld grater or the grater on your food processor. Alternately, place cauliflower in a food processor and pulse until it resembles rice. (If using prepackaged cauliflower rice or pearls, skip this step.)
Heat 3 tablespoons water in a pan over medium-high, add cauliflower bits and saute, stirring constantly, for about 4 – 5 minutes. Remove from heat, add rice vinegar and mix well. Set aside, let cool completely.
Assemble: Fill a little bowl with water and keep handy. Place a nori sheet, shiny side down, on the bamboo mat. On the edge closest to you, layer and press the cauliflower rice on 2/3 of the sheet.
Add the mango, avocado, cucumber and red cabbage lengthwise, leaving about 1 inch on the end.
Start rolling the nori, folding over the mango, avocado, cucumber and cabbage, give a good press to secure, and continue to roll. Using the water, wet your finger and dab the top end of the nori with water to seal. Let rest a few minutes before cutting, nori will soften and the seal will dry. Repeat, until ingredients are gone.
Using a clean, sharp knife, cut into 6 even rounds, total of 8 pieces. You may need to wipe clean the knife after each cut.
Serve with Dynamite sauce, or dipping sauce of choice.

Prepare the ingredients. Once you’ve sliced the avocados and removed the seeds, squeeze or rub a little lemon juice on the flesh to keep the browning at bay.
Place the cucumber, bell pepper, jalapeno, onion, and optional garlic and diced tomatoes in a small/medium mixing bowl, add just enough of the hummus or vegan mayo to bind.
Fill avocados and top with salt, pepper and squeeze of lemon. Adding a little chopped parsley will add even more color!

VEGAN 7 LAYER DIP///
vegetarian black or pinto refried beans, cumin, chipotle powder,  water, avocados, lime,  salt, Vegan Cashew Sour Cream, chunky salsa, sweet corn, roma tomatoes, black olives, green onions, cilantro, tortilla chips///
1 can (14 oz.) vegetarian black or pinto refried beans
1/2 – 1 teaspoon cumin
1/4 – 1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder, optional
2 – 4 tablespoons water
2 avocados (or 1 cup store bought guacamole)
1 large lime
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
1 cup Vegan Cashew Sour Cream or Vegan Queso)
1 cup chunky salsa (or Pico de Gallo)
1/2 cup sweet corn
1/2 cup roma tomatoes, diced and seeds removed (or red bell pepper)
1/4 cup black olives, sliced
1 – 2 green onions, sliced
fresh chopped cilantro, optional
1 bag tortilla chips, for serving///

Beans: In a small mixing bowl, add refried beans and mash well, add cumin, chipotle powder and 1/4 cup of water, mix well to combine. The water will help make the beans creamy so they aren’t too thick for dipping, add a little extra water as needed. If you prefer, heat the bean mixture over low until warmed through before assembly.
Guacamole: To make this simple guacamole, slice avocado lengthwise, twist the two halves to open, and remove the seed. Squeeze out the flesh (or scoop it out with a spoon) and place in a medium bowl with the juice of 1 lime and salt. Mash well, and season to taste with salt.
Assemble: To layer the bean dip, using a shallow dish of choice (pie dish, baking dish, or bowl), start with a layer of beans, spreading to the edges. Next, repeat with a layer of guacamole, sour cream, and salsa. Next, add the corn, tomatoes, green onion, and olives. Top with cilantro.
Serve: Pair with your favorite tortilla chips.
Serves 8 – 10
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for 2 – 3 days in a covered container.

BLACK BEAN + QUINOA BURRITOS (VEGAN FREEZER BURRITOS)///
dried quinoa, water, olive oil, red onion, bell pepper, diced tomatoes, zucchini, black beans, corn, cilantro, cumin, chili powder, chipotle powder,  garlic powder, onion powder,  salt, tortillas///
1/2 cup dried quinoa
3/4 cup + 1 or 2 tablespoons water
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water (for water saute)
1/2 large red onion, diced
1 orange bell pepper, seeds removed and diced
1 can (14oz) diced tomatoes, drained (or 2 roma tomatoes, seeds removed and diced)
1 medium zucchini, diced
2 cans (14 oz) black beans, drained and rinsed
1 can (14 oz) corn, drained
1/4 – 1/2 cup cilantro, roughly chopped
2 teaspoons cumin
1 teaspoon chili powder
3/4 – 1 teaspoon chipotle powder or 2 – 4 chipotles in adobe sauce
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
mineral salt, to taste
6 – 8 medium/large tortillas///

Quinoa: In a small/medium pot, combine the quinoa and water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 13 minutes. Remove lid, let set 10 minutes, fluff with a fork. Set aside.
Filling: In a large pan or pot, heat oil/water over medium heat, add onion and saute for 4 minutes, add bell pepper and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes, zucchini and corn, cook another 3 minutes or so (cook veggies until they are as soft as you like, I prefer mine to be a little al dente). Add the black beans, quinoa, cilantro, cumin, chipotle, garlic & onion powder, and salt, continue to cook until heated through.
Roll: Place tortillas on a flat surface, place a mound of the filling in the center, leaving room all the way around, fold in half, fold up each end, and roll the burrito away from you to completely close it.
Freeze: I try to avoid foil, so here I used paper sandwich bags. Feel free to use foil, freezer paper, saran wrap, plastic freezer ziploc bags or whatever you’re used to freezing with. If using the paper sandwich bags, they should be eaten within a few weeks to avoid freezer burn. Most likely they won’t be around that long!
Reheat: If at room temperature, warm in the oven/toaster oven at 375 degrees F for 10 minutes or so, or microwave for 30 seconds. If frozen heat in the oven at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, or microwave for 1:30 – 2 minutes.
Serve with sliced avocado and your favorite salsa (I paired mine with a hatch chili salsa). You may also like to pair it with any of these condiments: Cashew Sour Cream, Cilantro-Lime Cashew Cream, Chipotle Tahini Dressing, Cumin-Lime Tahini Dressing, Pico de Gallo, or Homemade Guacamole.
Enjoy these flavorful vegan freezer burritos!

GRILLED PEACH, CORN & ZUCCHINI QUINOA SALAD + LEMON-BASIL VINAIGRETTE///
///
1 cup dried quinoa
1 3/4 cups water or vegetable broth
2 peaches (ripe but firm)
2 corn on the cob
2 medium zucchini
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1 can (15 oz) chickpeas or 1 1/2 cup cooked, drained and rinsed
1/2 avocado
small handful pepitas (pumpkin seeds)
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste
handful or two of baby arugula, to serve (optional)

Lemon-Basil Vinaigrette

1/4 – 1/3 cup packed basil leaves
3 – 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 medium lemon)
2 – 3 teaspoons apple cider vinegar (wine, rice, sherry or white balsamic ok too)
1 small clove garlic, chopped
pinch of red pepper flakes
good pinch of mineral salt///

Quinoa: In a medium saucepan, add quinoa and water/vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Once done, remove lid and let rest for 10 minutes, fluff with fork.
Vinaigrette: Add all the ingredients to a small/personal food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Alternately, you can chop the basil really well and mince the garlic, then simply mix all the ingredients together in a small container – or add the basil to the salad and mix the remaining vinaigrette ingredients together. Set aside to let the flavors come together. Taste again before mixing to adjust flavor. Keep in the refrigerator if making a day or two in advance.
Prep: If corn has husks, either remove them or pull away and tie (as in the pics above), and remove all the silk threads from underneath. Cut peaches along the seam all the way around and twist halves off the pit. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise. If you like add a light of oil to the cut side of the peaches and zucchini before placing on the grill, I didn’t do this since I oiled the grill directly.
Grill: Prep your grill and add a light coat of oil. Start with the corn first, it will take the longest, about 10 minutes or so depending on your grill. Then add the zucchini and peaches cut side down. The last two should grill up fairly quickly, about 3 – 5 minutes. I leave mine al dente.
Shuck & slice: Once done, remove the corn off the cob. Using a large, shallow, rimmed baking dish or pie dish, hold the corn by its top horizontally in the center, use a knife to gently but firmly cut the corn from the cob from top to bottom. Give the corn a 90 turn and repeat, until all the corn is removed. Slice zucchini into 1/4 – 1/2 inch slices. Slice peaches into 1/8 – 1/4 inch slices. Slice tomatoes in half. Slice avocado in half, twist to separate halves, remove seed and slice thinly.
Combine: Add quinoa to a large mixing bowl, along with the peaches, corn, zucchini, tomatoes, chickpeas, avocado and pepitas, toss to combine. Add the dressing and mix again. Add mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper to taste.
Serve at room temperature or chilled. Enjoy as is or with a handful of arugula (this is especially good!).
Serves 4 generously
NOTES:
Change up the chickpeas with edamame.
Make this oil-free by simply squeezing a lemon or two over top the salad, just be sure to add plenty of chopped basil. A little mint would be great too.
Use farro or wheat berries in place of quinoa for variety.
I wanted to add sliced, or diced, red onion and forgot, feel free to add in about 1/2 red onion.

2 scallions, sliced
purple or green cabbage, shredded
avocado, sliced
cilantro
6 corn tortillas (or 9 organic corn tortilla sliders)
lime wedges, to serve
hatch chile cashew dressing or cilantro lime cashew cream, to serve///

Roast poblanos: Turn broiler to medium – high, place poblanos on baking sheet and place under the broiler for about 7 – 10 minutes, turning every few minutes to char and brown evenly on all sides. Poblanos will crackle and pop while cooking, they will be ready when charred and softened to the touch of a fork pushing on its side. Place poblanos in a bowl, cover with a plate or saran wrap and let steam for a few minutes (this will help loosen the skin for peeling). Remove the skin, lay the peeled poblano on a flat surface, remove the top and make a slit down the center, open and remove the seeds. Slice lengthwise into 1/2 inch strips.
Heat beans: Place beans in a small pot and cook over medium until warm, stirring occasionally. If using pinto or black beans, add a dash or two of garlic powder for a little extra flavor. You may decide to not heat your canned whole beans in which case, drain and rinse before using.
Prep veggies: Prepare scallions, purple cabbage and avocado. Heat your tortillas over the gas/electric burner until slightly charred.
Build: Layer your tacos with beans, poblanos, cabbage, scallions, avocado, cilantro and a sprinkle of pink salt & drizzle of cashew cream of choice or sriracha (or both!).

leafy greens of choice (I used baby kale)
cooked chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
carrots, grated or sliced
grape or cherry tomatoes, sliced in half
red onion, diced or green onion, sliced
cucumbers, sliced
1/2 avocado, sliced
big fat dollop of hummus
pepitas (pumpkin seeds), to garnish
hemp hearts, to garnish
1 lemon, squeezed at serving///

I’ll let you measure your ingredients. I used about 1/2 cup of chickpeas, 1/2 avocado and a small handful of carrots, tomatoes, onion and cucumber for each salad. Use however much you like depending on how big your salad is going to be.
Place your ingredients in your serving bowl, add a big dollop of hummus to the middle, sprinkle with seeds and a big squeeze of lemon. Say out loud, or to yourself, “I am grateful for all that is”, while keeping good thoughts in your mind. Then dig in and nourish yourself everyday!
Notes:
Add in any vegetables you prefer….broccoli florets, sliced zucchini, radishes, bell peppers, artichokes hearts, olives, etc. In the cooler months try adding in roasted vegetables like sweet potato, butternut squash, broccoli, carrots, etc. You can also add in some fresh herbs like parsley or cilantro if you have them on hand.
Sub in sunflower seeds and/or sesame seeds for the pumpkin seeds and hemp hearts.
For the best chickpea flavor, try making them fresh at home. It’s really easy and nothing beats the freshness of homemade chickpeas!
Enjoy and be grateful!

TOFU SCRAMBLE STUFFED POBLANO PEPPERS///
poblano peppers, organic tofu , olive oil, onion, mushrooms, bell pepper,  garlic powder, spinach , nutritional yeast, salt & pepper///
4 large poblano peppers
1 block (14 -16 oz.) organic tofu (firm or extra-firm), drained and pressed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)
8 oz mushrooms, sliced (I used baby bella)
1 small bell pepper, diced (any color)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
a large handful of fresh baby spinach (or chopped large leaf)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
mineral salt & pepper, to taste

To serve, optional

sriracha cashew cream or vegan aioli
avocado slices///

Roast poblano peppers using one of two ways.

Oven: Roast in preheated oven at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or so on a cookie sheet, turning halfway in between to flip peppers over.
Broiler: Roast your peppers in the broiler. To do this move the broiler pan about 6 inches away from heating element and preheat broiler. Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet and broil, turning often, until tender and blackened all over, 8 to 10 minutes. 

Steam peppers: Transfer to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to let steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
While peppers are roasting, drain the tofu. No pressing is needed since we’ll cook off most of the moisture, but while prepping the veggies I like to set the tofu on its side in the tub it came in so the excess water will drain.
Tofu scramble: In a large skillet/wok, heat oil over medium heat, add onions, and cook for 4 minutes. Add tofu, crumbling between your fingers, and cook for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, bell pepper and garlic powder, cook for another 3 – 4 minutes. Add spinach, cook for 2 – 3 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Add nutritional yeast and season with salt and pepper. Gently toss and cook for 1 minute.
Peel and de-seed peppers: Remove any loose skin off the peppers. Make one incision down the length of each pepper and carefully remove seeds. 
Stuff peppers: Scoop tofu mixture into peppers. If the peppers need to be heated, using the same baking dish you cooled the peppers in, place under broiler on low for a minute or two, watching closely so nothing burns.
Serve: Top with a drizzle or dollop of cashew cream and avocado slices. Salsa would also be great. I also loved having some warmed corn tortillas on the side as well.
Serves 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 – 15 minutes. Alternatively,  heat in the microwave for 1 – 2 minutes.

Place in a medium size bowl until ready to use. If using canned beans go to the next step and add the drained and rinsed canned beans as called for below.
Tomatillos: Prepare your tomatillos by removing the husks and washing them well to remove any of the sticky residue. Chop into quarters or six pieces depending on the size of your fruits. Cut and remove seeds from your jalapeno, and dice. Dice your onion and garlic.
Saute + Simmer: In a large pot, heat oil over medium high heat, add onion, saute for 5 minutes. Add in the garlic, tomatillos, jalapeno, cumin, coriander, and a pinch or two of salt, saute another 5 minutes. Add in the beans and liquids, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat and simmer for 1 1/2 – 2 hours (90 – 120 minutes), or until beans are tender, stirring occasionally.

Mash the beans: While the quinoa is cooking, drain and mash the white beans. You can quickly mash the beans in your colander if it has smaller-sized holes (it’ll save you a dish to wash). I mash about 3/4 of the beans, leaving a quarter of the batch whole or somewhat whole.
Add beans and flax meal: Once quinoa is done, remove the cover and stir in the mashed white beans and flax meal, mixing well. Let the mixture cool for 10 – 15 minutes. Taste for flavor – seasoning to taste with salt, pepper, and other spices.
Divide and make your patties: I like to pat my mixture into the bowl a little and divide it with a knife into 4 sections, making a plus sign if you will. Take each section and pack it tightly into a ball in the palm of your hands. Flatten with your palms and place on a hard surface. Cup the edges with your palm, tighten them in a bit, and squeeze together any cracks that have formed. Flatten the top to the desired size. Mine were about 1/2 inch thick with a 3 1/2 – 4 inch diameter.
Cook one of two ways:

Oven: In the oven at 375 degrees on a greased or parchment-lined cookie sheet for 30 minutes, turning once after 15 minutes. I also added a sprinkle of himalayan salt to the top before baking.
Stovetop: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon coconut oil or olive oil over medium to medium-high heat. Cook patties for about 4 – 5 minutes on each side. Burgers should be lightly charred, crispy, and browned on the outside with a tender center.

I cooked both ways and had no preference. They both held up well and cooked great.

1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (our favorite)
1/2 – 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
mineral salt, to taste

Carefully flip the tofu and cook another 5 minutes, until golden brown on both sides. Rotate the asparagus as needed to cook evenly. Once complete, turn off the heat. Add a few slices of lemon to the grill to give it a grilled look. It warms the lemon and makes the juices taste delicious!

EASY VEGAN MAYO///
organic tofu, oil, lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, salt, dijon mustard///
7 oz. organic tofu (silken or soft)
1/3 cup neutral oil (I used light flavored olive oil)
1 tablespoon lemon juice (about 1/2 medium lemon)
1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar
1/4 teaspoon salt, + more to taste
1/4 teaspoon dijon mustard///

Small Personal Blender: Simply add everything to the cup, attach the criss-cross blade, and blend for 1 minute. Taste for flavor. This is my preferred method and love my NutriBullet (affiliate link ) for small jobs like this!
Immersion Blender: Place the ingredients into a 2-cup measuring cup or tall straight glass (a mason jar would be great), and using the immersion blender, blend for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until creamy. Taste for flavor.
Regular Blender: This will work best when doubling this recipe. Simply place the ingredients in the blender, and process until smooth and creamy, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Taste for flavor.
Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

TERIYAKI TOFU-TEMPEH CASSEROLE///
organic tofu, tempeh, snow peas, baby carrots and broccoli florets, long grain rice, tamari, water, pure maple syrup ,  ginger, garlic, cornstarch///
10 oz. organic tofu (extra-firm or super firm), cubed
8 oz. tempeh, cubed
12 oz. combo of snow peas, baby carrots and broccoli florets or 1 bag (12 oz.) stir-fry vegetables (found in the produce section)
1 cup long grain rice or 3 cups cooked rice of choice (quinoa or cauliflower rice would be great too)

Teriyaki Sauce

3/4 cup tamari, low-sodium soy sauce or coconut aminos
3/4 cup water
1/2 cup pure maple syrup (or 1/3 cup cane sugar or coconut sugar)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 teaspoon freshly grated
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder or 1 garlic clove, minced
2 T. cornstarch or 3 T. tapioca flour + equal amount of water///

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
Prep tofu-tempeh: Drain tofu and place between a clean folded dish towel, place a medium pot on top for about 10 minutes to remove excess water. If using super firm tofu, skip this step. Once done, cube into 3/4 – 1 inch cubes. Cube the tempeh as well.
Make teriyaki sauce: In a small saucepan, add the tamari, water, maple syrup/sugar, ginger and garlic, bring to a boil, reduce heat and cook on low for 1 minutes. In a small bowl, mix together the cornstarch/tapioca powder with the water until smooth. Add the mixture to the teriyaki sauce and cook another minute, or until sauce thickens. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. Taste for flavor. If you like your teriyaki sauce on the sweeter side, add an extra tablespoon or two of your preferred sweetener.
Bake tofu-tempeh: In a 9×13 casserole or baking dish, add tofu and tempeh, drizzle with 1 cup of teriyaki sauce and gently toss to coat. Place in oven on middle rack and bake for 20 – 25 minutes. Turn down oven to 350 degrees F.
Cook rice: Cook rice according to package directions. I used basmati rice here which only took 20 minutes total to cook. Rice may vary in cooking time, some take as long as 40 minutes. If making a longer cooking rice you may like to start it earlier.
Steam veggies: Steam the veggies using a bamboo steamer, microwave or whatever is your preferred method.
Combine everything: In dish the tofu-tempeh cooked in, scoot the tofu and tempeh to one side, add the cooked rice and steamed vegetables. Pour most of the remaining teriyaki sauce overtop, reserving a little for serving, toss to combine. Enjoy as is or continue to next step to warm through if needed.
Bake: Place in preheated oven set to 350 degrees, uncovered, for about 10 – 15 minutes to heat through as needed (feel free to skip this step).
Serve: Place in individual bowls and top with a little remaining sauce. Would also be great with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds over top. Enjoy!

RAINBOW ASIAN ZUCCHINI NOODLE BOWL + CRISPY TOFU///
tofu, oil, garlic powder, pepper, onion, carrot, pea///
7 oz. organic tofu, use firm, extra-firm or super-firm
1 1/2 – 2 teaspoons sesame oil (or other neutral oil)
dash of garlic powder
2 large zucchini, spiralized or julienned
1 red bell pepper, thinly sliced
2 – 3 green onions, sliced into 1 inch pieces
1 cup shredded carrots or 2 carrots julienned
large handful snow peas///
Press & cook tofu:

If using firm or extra-firm tofu, you’ll most likely want to press it a bit to remove excess water (if using super-firm tofu you can skip this step).

Place tofu between a clean, double folded kitchen towel.

Place a heavy book or pot over top to use as a press.

Let set for at least 10 minutes, and up to 30 minutes.

Once done, slice tofu into 1 inch pieces, about 1/4 inch thick.

Heat a pan over medium heat, with 2 teaspoons of oil, twirl the pan to coat with oil.

Place tofu in pan and cook about 4 – 5 minutes, flip, sprinkle with a little garlic powder and cook another 4 – 5 minutes.

The time given here is for super-firm tofu. If using firm or extra-firm, you’ll most likely need to cook about 4 minutes longer on each side.

Tofu will be ready when golden on both sides. Set aside.

Mix dressing:

In a small bowl, combine the ingredients for the dressing and mix well.

Add water 1 tablespoon at a time to thin as needed.

If dressing becomes to thin, add a little nut butter.

Taste for flavor and set aside.

Keep in mind that the flavors will mellow into each other as it sits.

If using coconut amino’s, you may want to add a pinch of mineral salt.

Taste again for flavor before mixing with vegetables.

Prep and cook vegetables:

Once vegetables are prepped, heat wok or pan over medium-high heat.

Add the bell peppers, carrots, green onions, cabbage and snow peas, cook stirring constantly for 2 minutes.

We just want them to become ever so slightly softened (not too much).

Add zucchini noodles and cook for 2 more minutes, stirring constantly to ensure everything cooks evenly.

Remove from heat. Toss in tofu and cilantro, give a good stir.

Add peanut dressing over top and mix well to coat.

Serve:

Place portions in bowl and serve with lime wedges, chopped peanuts and optional bean sprouts. Easy, peasy – delicious!

NOTES:

If you’re a vinegar lover, feel free to add 1 tablespoon apple cider or rice wine vinegar to the dressing ingredients.

If allergic to peanuts, use sesame seeds instead (or cashews).

GRILLED BAJA TOFU TACOS + RED CABBAGE SLAW///
tofu, chipotle mayo or chipotle tahini sauce, pico de gallo, limes wedges, corn tortillas, lime juice, cumin, mineral salt, red cabbage, apple cider or red wine vinegar, cilantro, mineral salt///
1 (14 ounce) package non-gmo firm or extra-firm tofu, pressed
chipotle mayo or chipotle tahini sauce (recipe), to serve
pico de gallo, to serve (optional)
limes wedges, to serve
6 corn tortillas, to serve///

Press tofu:
Drain tofu, place block on its side and cut in half lengthwise. With halves still together, place tofu flat and cut into thirds on its longest side. You will get six pieces. Place tofu between a double folded kitchen towel and add a heavy book or pot over top to remove excess moisture. Let sit while you prepare the marinade.

Marinate:
In a small/medium size baking dish or pan (I used a loaf pan), mix together the lime juice, cumin and salt. Place tofu in mixture and marinate for at least 30 min, and up to 24 hours.

Cabbage slaw:
In a medium size mixing bowl, add the cabbage, vinegar, cilantro and salt, mix well and give a toss every now and then. Let set at least 10 min. Making it ahead a day or two is also great!

Grill tofu:
Heat grill over medium to medium-high heat. Add enough oil to generously coat the side of the griddle you’ll be using, about two tablespoons. Add a drop of water to the griddle, if it sizzles it’s ready. Place tofu on griddle, cook 3 – 4 minutes per side, or until you get nice grill marks. It helps to press the tofu with the back of a spatula to release excess liquids and aid in grill marks. Once done, set aside.

Serve:
Warm tortillas over medium-low heat on a gas or electric burner. Layer each tortilla with on piece tofu, red cabbage slaw and chipotle sauce. Top with optional pico de gallo and a squeeze of lime.

NOTES:
Don’t be shy with the toppings. Pile them as high as you like!

TOASTED AVOCADO-TOFU SANDWICH + SAUTEED ONIONS///
tofu, olive or grapeseed oil, garlic powder, salt, pepper, onion, tomato, avocados, bread, leafy greens, mustard or vegan mayo///
14 – 16 oz tofu (extra firm, firm or high protein)
2 tablespoons olive or grapeseed oil, divided
garlic powder
mineral salt
fresh cracked pepper
1 onion, thinly sliced
1 tomato, thinly sliced, optional
1 – 2 medium avocados
6 slices bread of choice
leafy greens of choice
favorite mustard or vegan mayo, to spread///
Slice and press tofu:

Remove tofu from package, turn on it’s side and carefully slice into 3 slabs.

Place slabs between 2 clean dishcloths or towels, lay a heavy object over top to press out excess moisture.

I used my large cutting board but a heavy cookbook will do the job too.

Let set under pressure for about 10 minutes.

Saute onions:

Peel and cut the ends off the onion, lay onion cut side down and cut in half.

Slice onion into thin strips, about 1/8 – 1/4 inch.

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet or medium size pan over medium heat.

Add onions and cook, stirring frequently, until golden and browned on the edges, about 10 minutes.

Remove from pan and set aside.

If you happen to leave your onions in the pan take note that they may continue cooking from the heat of the pan, pay close attention so they don’t burn too much.

Pan-fry tofu:

Heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium-high heat in a cast iron skillet or pan.

Add tofu and cook without touching for about 4 – 5 minutes per side, or until golden brown.

Sprinkle with salt and garlic powder after the first flip.

Prepare bread & avocado:

Toast your bread, or not, and slice your avocado.

You may even prefer to mash your avocado right in its shell with the back of a fork and spread like butter.

I find I use the latter method most often.

Assemble:

Layer your sandwich as you like.

I layered mine from bottom to top with mustard (dijon and habanero mix), leafy greens, tofu, sauteed onions, salt & pepper, avocado and more mustard.

Every bite was so delicious!

1 tablespoon sesame oil, optional
1 block (14 – 16 oz) organic tofu, firm or extra-firm
1 – 2 tablespoons tamari
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
4 – 5 large leaves of kale, center stem removed and julienned
3 scallions, sliced (divided)
1 – 2 tablespoons nutritional yeast, optional
1 cup kimchi

To Serve, optional

cilantro sprigs
sesame seeds (toasted, black or white)
lime wedges
6 corn or flour tortillas///

Open and drain tofu. No need to press the tofu.
In a large wok or skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Add tofu, crumbling between your fingers, cook, stirring occasionally, for about 2 -3 minutes.
Turn heat to medium, carefully add tamari and garlic powder, give a good stir. Add kale and 2/3 – 3/4 of the scallions, cook, stirring occasionally until kale becomes soft and wilts, cover partially to help with the process, about 5 – 7 minutes.
Lastly, add the nutritional yeast and kimchi, mix and cook just until kimchi has warmed through, about 1 minute or so. We don’t want to overcook the kimchi or it will destroy some of the health benefits of the probiotics.
If making optional tacos, heat the tortillas. I like to heat mine carefully over a gas burner until lightly charred in spots. Use your preferred method. Layer tortillas with the scramble mixture, add a few sprigs of cilantro, some of the reserved scallions, a sprinkle of sesame seeds and a squeeze of lime.

BLACK PEPPER TOFU///
organic tofu, toasted sesame oil, tamari, water,  pure maple syrup, cornstarch, fresh cracked pepper, garlic, ginger, scallions, chili’s peppers, cilantro///
1 block (14 – 16 oz.) organic tofu (super firm, extra firm or firm), cubed
1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil (sesame or grapeseed)
1/4 cup tamari, soy sauce or coconut amino’s
1/4 cup water or veggie broth
3 tablespoons pure maple syrup
2 teaspoons cornstarch (tapioca or arrowroot flour is fine too)
1 – 2 tablespoons fresh cracked pepper
3 – 4 cloves garlic, minced or 1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 1/2 inch knob ginger, minced
1 bunch scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
1 – 2 chili’s peppers, sliced and seeds removed or 1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1 bunch cilantro, roughly chopped, to serve///

Prep tofu: If not using one of the tofu’s mentioned above, you’ll want to drain and press your tofu to remove excess water. Simply cut tofu into slabs and place between paper towels or a clean dish cloth. With wrapped tofu laying on a flat surface, place a heavy book/object on top for about 15 minutes or so. Here’s a great tutorial from Olives for Dinner: How to press tofu perfectly in six steps.
Stir-fry sauce: In a small bowl, combine the tamari, water, sweetener and flour. This will be your slurry, ensuring your tofu will be coated nicely.
Cook tofu: Heat oil in a large wok or skillet over medium high. Add tofu and cook, stirring occasionally for about 10 minutes, or until golden on all sides. It doesn’t have to be perfect.
Add remaining ingredients: Add in your slurry mixture, ground pepper, garlic and ginger. It will sizzle at first when adding the liquids. Stir fry another 3 minutes or so, add in hot peppers and scallions. Liquids should start to thicken a bit, cook another 5 minutes or until the scallions are just softened.
Serve: Pair with brown rice, brown rice/quinoa mix, basmati or jasmine rice. Soba noodles would be great too. Add a large handful of chopped cilantro on the side, it will add to the flavors while giving a nice dose of freshness to the pepperiness. If you love cilantro, you will truly appreciate it here!

MUSHROOM, BELL PEPPER & BASIL STIR FRY///
organic, tofu, oil, mushrooms, bell peppers, onion, garlic, basil,  tamari, pure maple syrup, cornstarch, red pepper flakes///
1 block (14 oz) organic tofu, super or extra firm (organic pref)
1 – 2 tablespoons oil (sesame or olive) OR 1/4 cup for water saute (see notes)
8 oz. mushrooms
2 bell peppers (red & green)
1/2 large onion
3 cloves garlic
2 cups basil, lightly packed
1/4 cup tamari, coconut aminos or soy sauce
1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
2 teaspoons cornstarch or tapioca flour
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste///
Tofu:

If using non-high protein tofu, start by pressing your tofu (if using high protein tofu as mentioned above there is no need to press).

Place your block of tofu either between a few sheets/or folded paper towel OR between a clean folded dish cloth. Gently press around the entire block, add sides, with the towel to remove excess moisture.

Marinate tofu:

Cut the tofu into 3/4 inch cubes.

Add to a medium bowl and drizzle with 1 – 2 tablespoon of tamari, gently toss to coat.

Let tofu marinate while prepping the veggies.

Prep veggies:

Slice the onion lengthwise into strips about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick.

Cut to top off of the bell peppers, remove the core and seeds, slice lengthwise the same as the onions. Mince the garlic. Slice the mushrooms (or better yet buy them already sliced).

Mix sauce:

In a small bowl, combine the tamari, maple syrup, cornstarch and red pepper flakes.

Add 2 tablespoons of water. Set aside.

Sear tofu:

In a large skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat, add tofu and cook for 2 minutes without touching, flip and cook another 2 – 3 minutes. Transfer tofu a plate.

Basil stir fry:

In same large skillet or wok, add onions, garlic, bell peppers and mushrooms.

Stir fry for 5 minutes. Add in the wet mixture and toss to coat. Add in basil and tofu, mix well and cook another 5 minutes, or until vegetables are just softened, tofu is warmed and sauce has thickened.

Add more tamari and pepper flakes to taste.

Serve:

Pair with 1/2 cup grain of choice (white or brown rice, or quinoa) with a sprinkle of black sesame seeds on top.

TOFU SCRAMBLE STUFFED POBLANO PEPPERS///
poblano peppers, organic tofu , olive oil, onion, mushrooms, bell pepper,  garlic powder, spinach , nutritional yeast, salt & pepper///
4 large poblano peppers
1 block (14 -16 oz.) organic tofu (firm or extra-firm), drained and pressed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)
8 oz mushrooms, sliced (I used baby bella)
1 small bell pepper, diced (any color)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
a large handful of fresh baby spinach (or chopped large leaf)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
mineral salt & pepper, to taste

To serve, optional

sriracha cashew cream or vegan aioli
avocado slices///

Roast poblano peppers using one of two ways.

Oven: Roast in preheated oven at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or so on a cookie sheet, turning halfway in between to flip peppers over.
Broiler: Roast your peppers in the broiler. To do this move the broiler pan about 6 inches away from heating element and preheat broiler. Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet and broil, turning often, until tender and blackened all over, 8 to 10 minutes. 

Steam peppers: Transfer to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to let steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
While peppers are roasting, drain the tofu. No pressing is needed since we’ll cook off most of the moisture, but while prepping the veggies I like to set the tofu on its side in the tub it came in so the excess water will drain.
Tofu scramble: In a large skillet/wok, heat oil over medium heat, add onions, and cook for 4 minutes. Add tofu, crumbling between your fingers, and cook for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, bell pepper and garlic powder, cook for another 3 – 4 minutes. Add spinach, cook for 2 – 3 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Add nutritional yeast and season with salt and pepper. Gently toss and cook for 1 minute.
Peel and de-seed peppers: Remove any loose skin off the peppers. Make one incision down the length of each pepper and carefully remove seeds. 
Stuff peppers: Scoop tofu mixture into peppers. If the peppers need to be heated, using the same baking dish you cooled the peppers in, place under broiler on low for a minute or two, watching closely so nothing burns.
Serve: Top with a drizzle or dollop of cashew cream and avocado slices. Salsa would also be great. I also loved having some warmed corn tortillas on the side as well.
Serves 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 – 15 minutes. Alternatively,  heat in the microwave for 1 – 2 minutes.

1/2 cucumber, cut into matchsticks or 1/4 inch sticks
1/2 bell pepper (yellow, red or orange), thinly sliced
1/4 red cabbage, thinly sliced
1 cup greens (leafy lettuce, pea shoots, spring salad mix or micro greens)
8 oz. organic tofu (firm or extra firm), sliced (optional)
mint, small handful of leaves
cilantro, small bunch of sprigs
basil (regular or thai), small handful of leaves

Sweet Chili Sauce (2 servings)

1/4 cup unseasoned rice vinegar
2 tablespoons water
2 tablespoons maple syrup
1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
1 clove garlic, minced or grated
1 inch knob of ginger, minced or grated
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
juice of 1 lime

Peanut Sauce (2 servings)

1/4 cup nut butter (peanut or almond butter)
2 tablespoon pure maple syrup
2 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon tamari or soy sauce
1 inch knob of ginger, minced or grated
juice of 1 lime
1 – 2 tablespoon rice vinegar, optional
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional///

Dipping sauces: Mix your dipping sauce together first, let set so the flavors can mingle. It will taste much different after a few minutes. Taste for flavor before serving.
Water bowl: Fill a large bowl with warm water. Depending on the size of your sheets you can use a shallow pie dish or large bowl or pot.
Wet rice paper: Dip the rice paper in the warm water for just 2 – 3 seconds, it should be stiff, and will soften as you begin to work.
Assemble: On a non-porous work surface, lay the rice paper sheet and layer the ingredients on the edge closest to you at the 1/3 mark. Start with the leafy greens, carrots, cucumber, tofu, red pepper and herbs (really any way you want to layer is fine).
Tuck & roll: After layering the ingredients, ‘tuck and roll’ the edge closest to you, by bringing the edge up and over the fresh veggie mound. Gently but firmly, tuck it under and roll away from you. At the 2/3 mark, fold the ends up onto the roll, and continue rolling tucking them under until the roll is finished.

CARROT MISO SOUP///
sesame oil, carrots, onion, garlic, ginger, water, white miso paste, tofu, cayenne pepper, scallions///
1 tablespoon sesame oil or 1/4 cup water (for water saute)
2 – 2 1/2 lbs. carrots, peeled and chopped
1 large onion, diced
4 garlic cloves, minced
1 1/2 tablespoons fresh ginger, finely grated
4 cups water or vegetable broth (I used veg paste with water)
1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) white miso paste
2 – 4 oz. organic silken tofu, thin sliced 1 inch pieces (optional)
cayenne pepper as garnish, to taste
scallions or chives, thinly sliced///
Saute:
In a large dutch oven or pot, heat oil over medium heat, add onion and carrots, saute 5 minutes, or until translucent, add garlic and ginger, cook 1 minute more.

Simmer:
Add the liquids, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until carrots are tender.

Puree:
Let soup cool a bit. Add miso to soup and puree using 1 of 3 methods: An immersion blender right in the pot, a food processor or a regular blender. You may have to puree the latter two methods in batches.

Finishing:
Add a bit more water as needed. Taste for seasoning adding salt, especially if you didn’t use veggie stock you may like to add salt. Add pepper, more miso or grated ginger to taste.

Serve:
Ladle the soup into serving bowls, top with sliced tofu, a sprinkle of cayenne for some heat and a nice bunch of chives or scallions. Enjoy!

SMOKY CHIPOTLE TOFU SANDWICH (TLT)///
tofu, onion, olive oil, tomato, Dijon, avocados, leafy greens, salt,  bread, pure maple syrup, tamari, water, smoked paprika, chipotle powder,  garlic powder///
1 block (15 oz) organic tofu, firm or extra firm
1 onion, thinly sliced
2 tablespoons olive oil, divided
1 medium tomato, sliced thin
Dijon or stone ground mustard, to spread (Vegan Mayo is great too)
1 1/2 small avocados, mashed, to spread
a few leaves of your favorite leafy greens (red or green leaf, romaine, iceberg, etc)
salt, to taste
6 slices bread of choice///
Cut Tofu:

Remove tofu from the package.

Turn tofu on its side and slice in thirds, creating 3 large slabs.

Gently press each slab between a clean dish towel or paper towels to remove some of the excess water. Cut the slabs in half. You should have six pieces that look like large domino (rectangular) shapes.

Marinade Tofu:

In a medium sized shallow dish, mix together the marinade.

Place tofu in the dish and let soak for about 30 minutes – 1 hour turning carefully once or twice in between.

Saute Onions:

Once the hour is almost up, caramelize your onions using 1 tablespoon oil.

Heat oil over medium heat, add onions, turn down heat to medium low, stir often and cook until they start to brown and caramelize. May take 10 to 15 minutes or so. Once done, set aside.

Cook Tofu:

In same skillet, heat remaining oil and cook tofu over medium high heat.

Once tofu has browned, about 5 minutes, gently flip and brown the other side. It’s ok if it gets a little crispy too! If you feel it is drying out too much, add some of the juices from the bowl it marinated in for extra moisture. When done, remove from heat.

Build Sandwich:

Toast your bread.

Spread one side of toast with mustard and the other with a layer of mashed avocado, about 1/2 avocado. Over the avocado, layer your lettuce, tofu, onions and tomato.

Top with your other slice of bread.

CRISPY BLACKENED TOFU WITH KALE + QUINOA///
quinoa, water, garlic powder, salt, organic tofu, tamari, olive oil, paprika, black pepper,  cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, thyme, oregano, cayenne pepper, kale, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, olive oil, salt///
Quinoa

1 cup dried quinoa (I used tri-color from Trader Joe’s)
1 3/4 cups water
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
salt, to taste

Blackened Tofu

1 block (14-16 oz) organic tofu, super firm (pref) or extra firm
2 tablespoons tamari, coconut amino’s or light soy sauce
1 tablespoon olive oil

Spice Blend

2 teaspoons paprika
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon cornstarch, optional
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon thyme
1/2 teaspoon oregano
1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper

Sauteed Kale

chopped kale, I used 10oz organic package from Trader Joe’s
2 tablespoons of nutritional yeast
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water or veg broth
salt, to taste///

Quinoa:

Rinse your quinoa under cool running water to remove dust (if you forego this step your quinoa may have a bitter taste).
In medium pot add quinoa, garlic powder pinch of salt and water, bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover and simmer for 15 min.
Once done, uncover, stir and let set for 10 minutes to cool and soak up any excess water.
Fluff before serving. It will be a perfect quinoa, fluffy and sprouted.

Tofu prep:

Open and drain tofu.
Slice tofu into 4 large slabs, or whatever size you prefer.
Press tofu between paper towels or kitchen cloth to remove excess moisture.
In a shallow dish place tofu and tamari and let set while mixing the blackening seasoning, turn after a few minutes to let the other side soak.

Blackened Seasoning:

In a flat bottomed medium size bowl, combine all spice blend ingredients and mix until blended. This is fairly spicy so you may consider using less black pepper and/or cayenne.
Place tofu pieces in spice blend, press gently to get a good coating, turn and repeat on all sides.

Cook tofu:

In saute pan, heat oil over medium-high heat, add coated tofu and cook 5 minutes on each side.

Sauteed Kale:

In large wok or saute pan heat oil over medium heat, add kale and saute for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.
Sprinkle nutritional yeast and garlic powder over top, turning and moving the kale around to get all the spices mixed well throughout the kale.
Continue stir frying for another four to 5 minutes, or until bright green and just wilted. You may leave a cover on for a minute here and there in between stir frying to help soften the kale. When kale turns bright green it’s about ready to be removed from heat. Test a piece and see if it’s too your liking, if not saute a little longer. Some may like it crisp and some may like it softer.

Serves 4
For a change, the blackened tofu would also be great with classic sides like this Vegan Macaroni Salad, Vegan Potato Salad or Vegan Cornbread.
Store: Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, in a covered container.

2 cups flour (all-purpose, spelt, white whole wheat or combo)
2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/4 teaspoon mineral salt
3/4 cup organic pure cane or turbinado sugar
1 cup unsweetened almond milk*
1/3 cup olive oil (or fruit infused olive oil: lemon or orange)**
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 – 2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen***

optional garnish

a few extra blueberries
sprinkle of cane sugar///

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.
Mix wet ingredients: In a 2 cup measuring cup, add the milk, sugar, oil, and vanilla, stir to combine a few times to help soften the large grains of sugar.
Mix dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder and salt.
Combine wet & dry: Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture and mix until just combined. Don’t overmix, overmixing the batter tends to make the muffins less tender.
Add blueberries: Toss in the fresh or frozen blueberries and gently fold them into the batter.
Scoop: Fill each muffin-lined hole with batter. For uniformity, fill muffin tin using a 1/4 measuring cup or large ice cream scooper to scoop up the batter and pour into the muffin holes.
Topping: Optionally, add a few strategic blueberries on top and sprinkle the top with a little pure cane sugar or raw sugar. The sugar will add a nice crunch to the tops!
Bake: Place in the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Let cool a few minutes and enjoy warm or at room temperature.
Makes 12 muffins
Storing:

Counter & Fridge: Once completely cooled, store the muffins with a paper towel underneath and overtop in a container on the counter for up to 3 – 4 days. The paper towels will soak up moisture and keep them from getting too moist, losing their delicious crunchy top. They are also fine loosely covered for 1 – 2 days. Or store in the refrigerator for up to a week.
Freezer: Once completely cooled, wrap muffins individually and store them in a freezer-safe container or baggie for up to 2 months. When ready to eat let thaw to room temperature.

VEGAN BLUEBERRY BANANA OAT BREAD///
old fashioned oats,  flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, bananas, unsweetened almond milk, oil or applesauce, fresh blueberries, vanilla extract,  cinnamon///
1 1/4 cups (120g) old fashioned oats
1 1/4 cups (125g) light spelt flour
1/3 cup (47g) sugar (turbinado, coconut or pure cane)
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
generous pinch of salt
2 – 3 ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 to 1 1/4 cups (220-276g))
1/4 cup (56ml) unsweetened almond milk
1/4 cup (56ml) grapeseed or light flavored olive oil or applesauce
1 cup (100g) fresh blueberries (frozen is ok too)

optional add ins

1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon cinnamon///

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 9 x 5 loaf pan lightly with oil.
Combine: In a medium sized mixing bowl, add the flour, oats, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, optional cinnamon and pinch of salt, stir to combine.
Mash the bananas by hand in a small bowl, using the back of a fork or slotted spoon.
Mix: To the dry ingredients, add the mashed bananas, oil, plant milk and optional vanilla, mix to combine, just until the flour is incorporated. Best practice for mixing quick bread batter: Don’t overmix, as overmixing the ingredients will cause the gluten proteins to create an elastic batter that will not rise well.
Gently fold in the blueberries.
Pour the batter into a lightly greased 9 x 5 loaf pan. Optionally, add a few blueberries strategically to the top and sprinkle a small handful of oats over top. I added quick oats, but old fashioned oat would look nice too. You can also chop old fashioned oats into smaller pieces.
Bake: Place loaf pan in oven and bake for 50 – 55 minutes, rotating the pan once halfway through. Top will turn golden and toothpick placed in the center will come out clean.
Once done, let cool for 15 minutes in the pan. You should be able to tilt the pan and the loaf will come out clean, place on rack to cool completely.


Store covered on the counter for up to 3 days or in the refrigerator up to 1 week. Keep in the freezer for up to 3 months – place completely cooled loaves in freezer containers or bags. Thaw the wrapped loaves overnight in the refrigerator.

DIY MUESLI RECIPE///

5 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup sunflower seeds
1/2 cup pepitas (pumpkin seeds)
1/3 cup raisins or currants
1/3 cup dried blueberries
1/3 cup goji berries///

Place ingredients in your large jar, attach the lid and shake, twist and roll until evenly distributed. If using a large bowl, stir mixture and add to container of choice.
How to eat muesli:
Pour and serve: When ready to serve, add 1/2 – 3/4 cup of muesli to your bowl, add enough milk to cover and let set for about 5 minutes or so, until the oats soften a bit. Add a little sweetener of choice (I use a drizzle of maple syrup) and some fresh berries such as blueberries, raspberries, blackberries. Sliced strawberries and/or bananas would also be great. If you have dried mulberries on hand, throw some in as they taste great! When ready to eat, add a little extra milk as needed. Once you’ve made this a few times, you’ll find your perfect way.
Overnight muesli: Add about 3/4 cup muesli to a mason jar or bowl, top with fruits of choice if you like, and cover with milk. Seal or cover and keep in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 3 days (you can make a few so they’re ready to grab and enjoy, or take along with you). Mix before eating, add a little extra milk as needed (if at all).
Makes about 7 cups serving approx. 9 – 14
NOTES:
Feel free to add 1/2 cup of flaked or shredded coconut. You can change up the dried fruit by adding dried cranberries, chopped dates, cherries or apricots etc. Add any nuts and seeds you prefer. Slivered almonds are great in the mix. Mix and match as you like making this your own!
If you’re not going to top with any fresh fruit, feel free to add in another 1/2 cup or so of dried fruit of choice. Suggested ratio:

5 cups rolled oats
1 cup mixed nuts & seeds
1 cup mixed dried fruit (pref. unsweetened varieties)

1/4 – 1/3 cup coconut, almond, cashew, oat or any non-dairy milk
1 – 2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, coconut sugar or other sweetener of choice
1 – 2 tablespoon nuts and seeds of all kinds
sprinkle of cocoa nibs
1 – 2 tablespoons 100% fruit chia jam
1 – 2 tablespoons almond butter or nut butter of choice///

Simmer: In a dutch oven or large pot, steel cut oats, spices, salt, and water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, give a good stir, add more water as needed.
Rest overnight: Let cool, fill individual mason jars (or other containers), cover, and let sit overnight in the fridge. Alternatively, keep it in the pot you cooked it in, cover, and keep in the fridge overnight.
Fill jars: The next day fill your jars with a mix of toppings for grab & go time or simply top each jar when ready to eat.
I prefer to eat my breakfast jars at room temp but you can heat yours either in the microwave for a minute or two, or use a heated pot of water setting the mason jar in the center until warmed.
This will fill 4 – 6 pint-sized mason jars with plenty of toppings. Wide mouths are preferred as it’s much easier to spoon out of for eating.
Serves 4 – 6
Store: Keep breakfast jars in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

RAW FRUIT TARTS///
kiwi, strawberries, blueberries,  mango, cashew sweet cream, almonds or walnuts, dates, cinnamon, water///
1/4 cup kiwi, peeled and chopped
1/4 cup strawberries, chopped
1/4 cup blueberries
1/4 mango, chopped
cashew sweet cream

Crust

1 cup almonds or walnuts, or combo (I used almonds)
5 medjool dates
dash or two of cinnamon
2 tablespoons water, divided///

Cashew Sweet Cream: Make your cashew sweet cream, you can use right away or keep in the fridge for a few hours to thicken. Cashew cream can also be made a day or two ahead.
Crust: Make your crust by combining all the ingredients, except water, into a food processor/blender and blend until combined, and somewhat chunky. Add one tablespoon of water, and process until dough forms. Add the extra tablespoon of water if needed (you may find in your climate or altitude that you may not need it). We don’t want the dough too wet, just enough so that it combines nicely. Cover and place in the refrigerator for 20 min to stiffen.
Prep fruit: While dough is setting, prepare your fruits and set aside.
Assemble: Using molds of choice, line each with a piece of saran wrap or cut parchment paper (this will help to remove them so be sure to leave overhanging flaps). Fill each pan with a layer of dough, about 1/4 inch thick, by pressing firmly, yet gently into place. Fill each tartlet with cashew cream, almost to the rim, and level out, top with 1/3 cup of fruit.
Remove: To remove tart from mold, gently lift the edges of saran wrap or parchment paper, place on a flat surface, and using a spatula carefully wedge under the tart and move to desired flat surface.
Make ahead: You can prepare these a couple of hours ahead, cover them with saran wrap and store in the refrigerator until ready to eat. Makes 3 three-inch fruit tarts using the mini cake molds. Each fruit tart is about 2 servings.

STUFFED ACORN SQUASH + WILD RICE MEDLEY///
acorn squashes, olive oil , thyme, salt, wild rice, olive oil , red bell pepper, onion, garlic, mushrooms, spinach, cannellini beans, thyme, red pepper flakes, salt and cracked pepper///
3 acorn squashes, cut in half lengthwise and seeds removed
olive oil (to roast oil-free see notes)
1 teaspoon thyme, divided
sea salt

Wild Rice Medley

1 cup wild rice, dry (I used half black wild rice and half long grain brown rice)
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water
1 medium/large red bell pepper, diced
1 small onion or 1 large shallot, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
8 oz. mushrooms (about 2 cups), sliced
2 large handfuls baby spinach (baby kale or chard is great too, or a combo)
1 can cannellini beans (15 oz), drained and rinsed
1 teaspoon thyme (dried or fresh)
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, optional
sea salt and cracked pepper to taste///

Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or silicone mat. In an ovenproof saucepan, fill halfway with water and place on the bottom rack (this will give a little steam to your squash).
Prep and roast the squash: Cut and seed your squash, place on baking sheet with cut side up. Brush each half with a little oil, and season with a sprinkle of thyme, salt and pepper. Place in the oven and bake for 40-45 minutes, until tender, knife should easily pierce the flesh. If by chance your squash is done first, cover with foil to keep it from drying out.
Rice: Cook your rice according to package directions. Wild rice will take about the same time as the squash to cook, about 40-45 min. Set aside.
Veggies: In large pan, heat oil on medium heat. Add onion and cook for 5 minutes, add garlic and cook 1 minutes. Add the mushrooms, bell peppers, thyme, red pepper flakes, a few twists of salt and pepper, cook for another 5 minutes or so, until the mushrooms start to sweat and soften. Add the beans and leafy greens, stir frequently until they are wilted and warmed through (you may also want to use a cover in between stirring to help soften the greens).
Wild Rice Medley: Combine the rice and sautéed vegetables in the larger of the two pots. Taste for seasoning adding additional salt and pepper as needed.
Stuff: Scoop mixture into each acorn squash half and serve with any additional seasonings. I actually like to top mine with some sriracha for that extra heat and flavor I love so much. :)
Serves 6 (or 3 for the hearty eaters).
Store: Leftovers can be kept in an airtight container in fridge for up to 4 – 5 days.
NOTES:
Quinoa or quinoa/rice combo would be great too and add even more protein per serving.
To make this oil free, omit the oil when roasting the squash and roast the squash cut side down to keep the moisture in. You can still add a little salt and pepper, and place a sprig of thyme underneath so the flavor with infuse the squash a little. Use water in place of oil when sauteing the vegetables.
RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT: I love my Silpat or these parchment liners for lining this rimmed baking sheet (affiliate links). For more of my favorite cooking tools, shop my kitchen essentials!

1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or as needed
1 quart (4 cups) mushroom or vegetable broth
mineral salt & fresh ground black pepper, to taste
1/2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, or to taste (optional)///

Heat oil over medium heat, add mushrooms and season with a pinch of salt. Simmer mushrooms, stirring occasionally, until liquid is almost evaporated, about 15 minutes.
Add flour, continue cooking and stirring for about 3 – 5 minutes, at least until the flour has been absorbed and not white anymore. Add 1 cup of broth, stirring/whisking briskly until incorporated and liquid has thickened, there should be no flour lumps, about 5 minutes.
Slowly pour in the remaining broth and mix thoroughly. Season with black pepper and thyme. Simmer at a gentle boil over medium-low until thickened, about 20 minutes, stirring often. Gravy will thicken upon standing. Taste for flavor, adding more salt and pepper as needed.
Makes about 4 cups.
Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 5 – 6 days. To freeze, let the gravy cool and store in an airtight container in the freezer for up to 2 months. Let thaw in the refrigerator and reheat in a saucepan, whisking to recombine.
NOTES:
If you find the gravy isn’t thickening up, mix 1 tablespoon oil with 1 heaping tablespoon flour, mix well until completely blended, add to simmering broth, stirring until dissolved, continue cooking until thickened.
I used mushroom gravy when making this recipe which gave it a rich brown color, if using vegetable broth your gravy may be lighter in color.

TOFU SCRAMBLE STUFFED POBLANO PEPPERS///
poblano peppers, organic tofu , olive oil, onion, mushrooms, bell pepper,  garlic powder, spinach , nutritional yeast, salt & pepper///
4 large poblano peppers
1 block (14 -16 oz.) organic tofu (firm or extra-firm), drained and pressed
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 small onion, diced (about 1 cup)
8 oz mushrooms, sliced (I used baby bella)
1 small bell pepper, diced (any color)
1 teaspoon garlic powder
a large handful of fresh baby spinach (or chopped large leaf)
1/4 cup nutritional yeast
mineral salt & pepper, to taste

To serve, optional

sriracha cashew cream or vegan aioli
avocado slices///

Roast poblano peppers using one of two ways.

Oven: Roast in preheated oven at 450 degrees for 20 minutes or so on a cookie sheet, turning halfway in between to flip peppers over.
Broiler: Roast your peppers in the broiler. To do this move the broiler pan about 6 inches away from heating element and preheat broiler. Place poblano peppers on a baking sheet and broil, turning often, until tender and blackened all over, 8 to 10 minutes. 

Steam peppers: Transfer to a large bowl, cover tightly with plastic wrap and set aside to let steam for 10 to 15 minutes.
While peppers are roasting, drain the tofu. No pressing is needed since we’ll cook off most of the moisture, but while prepping the veggies I like to set the tofu on its side in the tub it came in so the excess water will drain.
Tofu scramble: In a large skillet/wok, heat oil over medium heat, add onions, and cook for 4 minutes. Add tofu, crumbling between your fingers, and cook for 3 minutes. Add mushrooms, bell pepper and garlic powder, cook for another 3 – 4 minutes. Add spinach, cook for 2 – 3 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Add nutritional yeast and season with salt and pepper. Gently toss and cook for 1 minute.
Peel and de-seed peppers: Remove any loose skin off the peppers. Make one incision down the length of each pepper and carefully remove seeds. 
Stuff peppers: Scoop tofu mixture into peppers. If the peppers need to be heated, using the same baking dish you cooled the peppers in, place under broiler on low for a minute or two, watching closely so nothing burns.
Serve: Top with a drizzle or dollop of cashew cream and avocado slices. Salsa would also be great. I also loved having some warmed corn tortillas on the side as well.
Serves 4
Store: Leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 4 days, in a covered container. Reheat in the oven at 350 degrees for 10 – 15 minutes. Alternatively,  heat in the microwave for 1 – 2 minutes.

SAVORY CHICKPEA PANCAKE (GF)///
chickpea flour, water, baking soda ,  turmeric, cumin, garlic powder,  salt,  lemon, greens,  mushrooms, shallot, grape tomatoes///
2/3 cup chickpea flour (aka garbanzo bean or besan)
2/3 cup water
1/2 heaping teaspoon baking soda (can be optional)
pinch of turmeric (will give it a yellow color), optional
1/2 teaspoon cumin, or to taste
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
mineral salt, to taste
juice of 1/2 small lemon or 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar

Add-ins:

2/3 cup greens (kale or spinach), julienned and loosely packed
small handful mushrooms, thinly sliced
1/2 shallot, finely diced
7 grape tomatoes, halved or quartered depending on the size///

Preheat griddle on medium.
Mix: In a medium size bowl, combine flour, water, baking soda, optional turmeric, cumin, garlic powder and salt to taste. Mix well ensuring all the flour lumps are gone. Add in lemon, stir and you will notice the batter rise and foam a bit. Add in veggies and combine thoroughly. (Note: I don’t really measure the vegetables, so this is an approximation)
Cook: Pour 1/2 of the mixture onto the preheated griddle or skillet. You can use your spatula to move the veggies around and flatten as needed if they are piled up in areas. Also you can help make your pancake round by gently pushing in the edges where needed. There may be times when it appears that you have more veggies than batter, don’t panic….in a few minutes the batter will puff up from the baking soda and fill in making it look fluffy and full. Let cook for 5 minutes. Flip and cook another 5 – 7 minutes, making sure the batter cooks throughout.
Serve with your choice of condiments. A thinned hummus would also be great! Pairs well with fresh fruit on the side.
Makes 2 pancakes

himalayan salt & cracked pepper to taste///

Add the white wine and boil for a couple minutes. Add kale, and continue cooking until soft, about 4 minutes.
Add the cream and milk, let simmer for several more minutes. Turn off heat. (If you have time, leave this mixture to steep; the cream and milk will get wonderfully mushroomy.) Season with salt and pepper.
Transfer the mixture to a shallow baking dish. Place in the oven and bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden and bubbly. Top with a light dusting of almond parmesan.
Serve over a bed of farro, barley, white or brown rice, pasta or pasta of choice. Top with a tad more almond parmesan and salt & pepper to taste. Enjoy with the rest of the wine or a nice glass of lemon water.

1 – 2 green onions, thinly sliced (optional)
1 batch Raw Marinara Sauce (using basil)

Prep veggies: Start by preparing your veggies. Spiralize or julienne (either by hand or with a julienne tool) the zucchini & squash for the pasta. Set aside.
Meatballs: Place ingredients for the meatballs into your food processor/blender, blend until well combined but still a bit chunky (not too chunky, but just a very minimal amount). Taste for seasoning. Scoop out 3 tablespoons of mixture at a time and form into balls by gently flipping back and forth between your palms and use your fingers to mold making a nice circle shape. Makes about 8. Set aside.

VEGAN STREET TACOS///
walnuts, mushrooms, tamari, cumin, chili powder, olive oil , onion, green bell pepper, garlic, quinoa, tomato paste, low-sodium vegetable broth, salt + pepper, tortillas, Black Bean Corn Salad, cilantro, lime wedges, pico de gallo, avocado, hot sauce///
Taco Nut Meat

1 cup walnuts
1 cup mushrooms (I used baby bellas)
1 tablespoon tamari, soy sauce or coconut amino’s
1 tablespoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon chili powder

Spanish Quinoa

1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water
1/2 onion, diced
1 green bell pepper, diced (any color is ok), optional
1 – 2 cloves garlic, minced or 1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 cup quinoa, rinsed
1 tablespoon tomato paste or 1 cup diced tomatoes
2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water
salt + pepper, to taste///

Spanish quinoa (serves 6):

In medium size pan or skillet, heat oil over medium high heat, add onion, optional bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes, add quinoa and garlic, cook another 5 minutes or so stirring frequently until quinoa starts to get toasty and turn slightly golden.
Add water, tomato paste, oregano, salt + pepper, bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes.
When done, remove cover, fluff with the a fork, and let set for 15 minutes to absorb the rest of the liquids. Taste for seasonings before serving.

Nut meat (makes 6 tacos):

Place all ingredients in food processor/blender and pulse until you have chunky crumbles. Don’t over process or you will have a nut mushroom pate, which wouldn’t be so bad but we want a crumbly effect here. For visual steps, see this Walnut Meat recipe.
Optionally, heat the nut meat on low just until warm in a small saucepan. You don’t want to overheat or the mushrooms will cook too much, just slightly warm it. I find both ways, warm and room temp, to be just as appealing. Makes enough for 6 tacos.

Warm your tortillas on the griddle or skillet for 30 seconds per side.
Serve: Put your plates and tacos together as you wish! You may find that you end up combining the black bean salsa with the Spanish fried quinoa. You may also find yourself making tacos out of both of those side dishes as well. However you craft your plate, enjoy!

EASY VEGAN CALZONES///
pizza dough, olive oil, onion, garlic, dried thyme, portobello mushrooms, broccoli florets, kale, tomatoes, salt and pepper, raw cashews, water, garlic, white miso,  lemon, himalayan salt & pepper///
1 1b. pizza dough (I used Trader Joe’s), divided into 4 sections
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water
1/2 onion, sliced or diced
2 – 3 garlic cloves, minced
2 teaspoons dried thyme
3 large portobello mushrooms (about 6oz.), sliced
1 1/2 cups broccoli florets, cut somewhat small
4 – 6 large leaves of kale (curly or flat), stems removed and roughly chopped or left somewhat whole
large handful cherry or grape tomatoes, sliced in half
himalayan salt and pepper, to taste
cornmeal for dusting the pizza wheel

Garlic Cream Sauce

1 cup raw cashews, soaked (see notes)
1/2 cup water, plus a little more as needed
2 – 3 cloves garlic
2 teaspoons white miso
juice of 1 lemon
himalayan salt & pepper, to taste///

Prep dough: Remove pizza dough, slice into 4 equal pieces, sprinkle with a little flour, lay a towel overtop and let pizza dough come to room temp away from oven heat for 30 minutes.
Garlic-miso cream: Drain cashews and place all ingredients for the cream into a small blender cup and process until creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. If cream is too thick and extra water 1 tablespoon at a time until desired consistency, being careful not to thin it out too much making it runny, if in doubt leave it on the thick side. Taste for seasoning, set aside.
Saute veggies: In large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion, garlic and cook until onions become soft. Add in mushrooms, broccoli, kale, thyme and salt & pepper to taste, cook for another 5 minutes or so. Turn off heat and cover ajar to help steam and soften the veggies a little more while working on the next step.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Place pizza stone or cast iron pizza pan in the oven to heat up.
Make calzone: On a lightly floured surface or parchment paper, roll each portion out into an eight inch oval, rectangle, circle – whatever works easiest for you. Lay on some of the veggie mixture, add a few heaping tablespoons of the garlic miso cream and top with tomatoes. Fold the other half over and seal the edges by pressing with a fork. Make a few small slits in the top so steam is able to release. Top with a light coat of olive oil and a sprinkle of salt, pepper and thyme.
Bake: Dust the heated pizza stone with cornmeal, place calzone on the pizza stone (or if using parchment paper, transfer to pan or stone) and bake for 15 – 20 minutes, until crust is puffy and golden brown. Let cool a few minutes before serving.
Serve with garlic miso sauce on the side.
Store: Calzones can be kept in a covered container in the refrigerator for up 4 days. Reheat in a toaster oven or microwave.

SPAGHETTI + ITALIAN VEGAN MEATBALLS///
pasta, marinara sauce,  olive oil , mushrooms, yellow onion, garlic, walnuts or sunflower seeds, beans, oats, Italian seasonings, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper///
12 oz. pasta or 2 spaghetti squash
1 jar (25 oz.) marinara sauce (or pasta sauce of choice)

Bean Balls

1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water, for water saute
8 oz. mushrooms (about 8 oz), sliced (I used cremini)
1 small yellow onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup walnuts or sunflower seeds, optional
1 can (15 oz) beans (cannellini, chickpeas, kidney or black beans), drained and rinsed
1 cup of oats (old fashioned or quick oats)
1 tablespoon Italian seasonings (sub with dried oregano, basil, thyme or a mixture of these)
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
pinch of red pepper flakes, to taste
sea salt and pepper, to taste///

Saute: In a skillet or pan, heat oil or water over medium heat. Add mushrooms, onion and garlic, add saute for 5 minutes, adding the herbs during the last minute. Let cool for a few minutes.
Food processor: If using the nuts/seeds, place in food processor first and pulse until coarsely ground, and continue. Also, if using old fashioned oats place them in the with the nuts to chop them up a bit. Add the beans, sauteed veggies, oats. Pulse until just combined (don’t overmix or it’ll turn into a paste). Taste for seasoning adding anything extra you may like. I added in some fresh chopped basil I had on hand.
Shape vegan meatballs: Roll mixture into balls, about 1 1/2 – 2 inches, and place on a baking sheet. I was able to get 10 jumbo sized bean balls. You can easily make smaller balls, yielding 16 – 20.
Cook in 1 of 2 ways:

Bake: Place balls on a baking sheet lined with parchment or silicone mat. Put in the oven on the middle rack and bake for 25 – 30 minutes at 400 degrees F. If roasting spaghetti squash, add in while the squash is cooking. Remove both when time is up and let cool.
Stovetop: In a skillet or shallow pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat, add meatballs and cook for 15 – 20 minutes, turning often to brown all sides.

Cook sauce + meatballs: Add the pasta sauce and meatballs together, cook over low for 10 minutes, or until sauce is warmed through.
Pasta: Cook the pasta according to package directions. If using spaghetti squash, see How To Cook Spaghetti Squash
Serve: In individual bowls serve spaghetti topped with sauce and vegan meatballs. Top with salt, pepper, and chopped fresh parsley or basil. A nice dusting of Almond Parmesan will also enhance this dish!

Alfredo Sauce: Remove any leaves and core the bottom of the cauliflower. Cut cauliflower into large florets and place in pot of boiling water. Cook for about 20 minutes, or until soft, drain. While cauliflower is cooking, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in saute pan over medium to medium high heat, add shallots and cook until soft and lightly browned.
Place cooked cauliflower in blender/food processor along with beans, milk, shallots and nutmeg. Blend until creamy. Taste for flavor adding salt, pepper and any other spice you might like. Also, if sauce is too thick add a splash or so more milk (or water) as needed, blend again.
Veggies: In same saute pan you cooked the shallots, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium heat. Add mushrooms, kale, sun-dried tomatoes and red pepper flakes. Saute kale until it has sweated down, approx 5 min. You could use a cover to help. Turn off heat when done.
Pasta: Cook according to package instructions.
Assemble: Place cooked pasta back to the same pot it was cooked in, add as much sauce as you like. Stir gently to coat. Add a tad more sauce if needed. Alternately, add the veggie mix to the pasta and mix. Turn heat to low and cook until warmed through adding a splash or so of milk if needed to keep from drying out. We want to keep it moist and creamy.
Pairs well with this Artisan Bread!
Store: Keep remaining sauce or any leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge. Will last up to a week. When reheating, add more non-dairy milk to maintain creaminess if needed.

2 tablespoons sesame oil or vegetable broth/water
2 tablespoons tamari, soy sauce, nama shoyu or coconut aminos (I used tamari)
juice of 1 – 2 medium lemons or 2 – 3 small limes
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes, adjust to your liking

Optional Garnish

1/4 cup wakame, rehydrated and drained, chopped**

BASIL-WALNUT PESTO + MUSHROOMS, JALAPENO & SUN-DRIED TOMATOES///
tomatoes, mushrooms, jalapenos, olive oil, pasta, almond parmesan///
2/3 cup sun-dried tomatoes, softened
8 oz. package mushrooms, sliced
2 jalapenos, sliced and seeds discarded
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
8 oz. pasta of choice
almond parmesan, for topping

Walnut Basil Pesto

2 cups basil, packed
1/2 cup walnuts
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoon lemon
3 or 4 garlic cloves
himalayan salt & pepper to taste (I used white pepper)
1 tablespoon nutritional yeast, optional*///

Start with your pesto by combining ingredients in food processor, process until blended and creamy, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Set aside.
Cook pasta according to package, drain and return to pot you cooked it in. Add a small amount of oil and toss to coat.
In saute pan heat oil over medium, saute mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes and jalapeno for 4 – 5 minutes or until mushrooms are tender. It should be smelling pretty delicious about now! Remove from heat.
Toss pasta with pesto. Place pasta on individual serving dishes and top with sauteed vegetables, add salt and pepper to taste. Top with almond parmesan for even more flavor.
Serves 2 – 3
NOTES:
I didn’t use the nutritional yeast in my recipe, it’s a good healthy option for those seeking to replace the cheese flavor in other pesto recipes. Add slowly until you find the amount you like.
Use as much of the sun-dried tomatoes, mushrooms and jalapeno pepper as you like.
Use rice or quinoa pasta to make this gluten free.

CREAMY ZUCCHINI PESTO WITH ‘NOODLES’///
zucchini, zucchini, basil, garlic, tahini, himalayan salt///
‘Noodles’

2 zucchini (1 per person), cucumber would be good too

Pesto (serves two)

2 small zucchini or one large
2 cups fresh basil
2 cloves garlic
2 tablespoons tahini
1/2 teaspoon himalayan salt, or to taste///

Noodles: Use a spiralizer to create the ‘noodle’ effect, or you can julienne them. Both ways are great but I do highly recommend the spiralizer if you intend on making raw ‘noodles’ often. It’s really fun and easy to use.
Pesto: Cut zucchini into 1-inch chunks. Steam chunks over boiling water for about 3 minutes, or until just tender when pierced with a sharp knife. I kept mine a little stiff, I wanted this to be as raw as possible.
Place all ingredients in food processor/blender and process until finely chopped.

VEGTABLE QUINOA SOUP///
carrots, celery, onion, cabbage, zucchini, diced tomatoes, beans, dry quinoa,  herbes de provence, thyme & rosemary, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, water or vegetable broth, mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper///
2 large carrots, sliced or diced
2 stalks celery, sliced
1 onion, diced
1/4 head of cabbage, chopped
2 medium zucchini, cut in half & sliced
1 can (14 oz.) diced tomatoes with juices (pref. fire roasted)
2 cans (14 oz.) beans of choice, drained and rinsed (I used one can white beans & one can three bean medley)
1/3 cup dry quinoa
2 teaspoons herbes de provence or 1 teaspoon each thyme & rosemary
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
pinch of red pepper flakes, optional
6 cups water or vegetable broth
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste///

Slow Cooker:

In 5 – 6 quart crockpot, place ingredients in the bottom starting with the carrots and ending with the liquids.
Cook on LOW for 6 – 8 hours, or HIGH for 3 – 5 hours. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste.

Instant Pot:

Set Instant Pot to SAUTE and add the 1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water, onion, carrot, and celery, saute for 5 minutes, adding the herbs and garlic powder in the last minute (feel free to skip this step entirely adding everything to the pot and cooking).
Add quinoa, beans, cabbage, zucchini, tomatoes, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and vegetable broth, stir to combine.
Attach lid and turn to the lock, set the valve to SEALING, and manually set to HIGH pressure for 3 minutes (takes about 25 minutes to come to pressure). Let natural release for 10 minutes. Season to taste.

Stovetop:

In a large pot or dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon oil (or 1/4 cup water for water saute), add onions, carrots and celery, saute for 5 minutes.
Add remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, cover, turn heat to low and simmer for 35 minutes – 1 hour. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper to taste.

Serve with your favorite artisan bread. Add diced avocado for another layer of flavor.

CREAMY PUMPKIN SAUCE & ZUCCHINI NOODLES///
100% pumpkin puree, unsweetened cashew milk , olive oil, shallot, garli, vegan sausages, kale, thyme, zucchini,  salt & fresh cracked pepper///
1 can (14 oz.) 100% pumpkin puree
1 1/2 cups unsweetened cashew milk
1 tablespoon olive oil or 3 tablespoons water (for water saute)
1 small shallot, minced
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 vegan sausages, sliced
5 large lacinato kale leaves, stems removed and julienned
3/4 teaspoon dried thyme or 1/2 teaspoon fresh chopped
4 large zucchini, spiralized or julienned
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper to taste///

In a medium size bowl, combine the milk and pumpkin puree, set aside.
In a large pan, heat oil over medium, add shallot and saute for 4 minutes, add garlic, sausage, kale and thyme, cook until kale softens, stirring occasionally, about 3 – 4 minutes.
Turn heat to medium-low, add the pumpkin mixture, and give a good stir. Add in the zucchini noodles, using tongs, mix to coat, place the cover askew and let simmer 4 – 5 minutes, or until zucchini has become al dente, stirring occasionally. If the sauce is bubbling too much, reduce heat to low. Taste for flavor adding salt & pepper to taste.
Pairs great with a dusting of almond parmesan and slice of your favorite artisan bread.
Serves 3 – 4
NOTES:
Try using mushrooms in place of the sausage if you like. Simply add the mushroom with the shallots and cook until mushrooms have just started to sweat down. Continue with the kale and thyme, and so on…
Spiralized sweet potato would be great here too!
Use your favorite pasta. There’s enough sauce for about 12 – 16 oz. of pasta. Cook the pasta according to package directions and add it in the recipe in place of the zucchini. Easy peasy!
If you have garlic and powder on hand, try adding a dash or two. It will ensure full flavor.
RECOMMENDED EQUIPMENT: For spiralizing zucchini noodles I love use this spiralizer , and for straight noodles use a hand held julienne tool. For more of my favorite cooking tools, shop my kitchen essentials.

GRILLED PEACH, CORN & ZUCCHINI QUINOA SALAD + LEMON-BASIL VINAIGRETTE///
quinoa, peaches, corn, zucchini, cherry tomatoes, chickpeas, avocado, pepitas, pepper, baby arugula///
1 cup dried quinoa
1 3/4 cups water or vegetable broth
2 peaches (ripe but firm)
2 corn on the cob
2 medium zucchini
1 cup cherry tomatoes
1 can (15 oz) chickpeas or 1 1/2 cup cooked, drained and rinsed
1/2 avocado
small handful pepitas (pumpkin seeds)
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste
handful or two of baby arugula, to serve (optional)

Lemon-Basil Vinaigrette

1/4 – 1/3 cup packed basil leaves
3 – 4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1 medium lemon)
2 – 3 teaspoons apple cider vinegar (wine, rice, sherry or white balsamic ok too)
1 small clove garlic, chopped
pinch of red pepper flakes
good pinch of mineral salt///

Quinoa: In a medium saucepan, add quinoa and water/vegetable broth. Bring to a boil, cover, reduce heat to low and simmer for 15 minutes. Once done, remove lid and let rest for 10 minutes, fluff with fork.
Vinaigrette: Add all the ingredients to a small/personal food processor and blend until smooth and creamy. Alternately, you can chop the basil really well and mince the garlic, then simply mix all the ingredients together in a small container – or add the basil to the salad and mix the remaining vinaigrette ingredients together. Set aside to let the flavors come together. Taste again before mixing to adjust flavor. Keep in the refrigerator if making a day or two in advance.
Prep: If corn has husks, either remove them or pull away and tie (as in the pics above), and remove all the silk threads from underneath. Cut peaches along the seam all the way around and twist halves off the pit. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise. If you like add a light of oil to the cut side of the peaches and zucchini before placing on the grill, I didn’t do this since I oiled the grill directly.
Grill: Prep your grill and add a light coat of oil. Start with the corn first, it will take the longest, about 10 minutes or so depending on your grill. Then add the zucchini and peaches cut side down. The last two should grill up fairly quickly, about 3 – 5 minutes. I leave mine al dente.
Shuck & slice: Once done, remove the corn off the cob. Using a large, shallow, rimmed baking dish or pie dish, hold the corn by its top horizontally in the center, use a knife to gently but firmly cut the corn from the cob from top to bottom. Give the corn a 90 turn and repeat, until all the corn is removed. Slice zucchini into 1/4 – 1/2 inch slices. Slice peaches into 1/8 – 1/4 inch slices. Slice tomatoes in half. Slice avocado in half, twist to separate halves, remove seed and slice thinly.
Combine: Add quinoa to a large mixing bowl, along with the peaches, corn, zucchini, tomatoes, chickpeas, avocado and pepitas, toss to combine. Add the dressing and mix again. Add mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper to taste.
Serve at room temperature or chilled. Enjoy as is or with a handful of arugula (this is especially good!).
Serves 4 generously
NOTES:
Change up the chickpeas with edamame.
Make this oil-free by simply squeezing a lemon or two over top the salad, just be sure to add plenty of chopped basil. A little mint would be great too.
Use farro or wheat berries in place of quinoa for variety.
I wanted to add sliced, or diced, red onion and forgot, feel free to add in about 1/2 red onion.

SIMPLE UDON NOODLE BOWL///
udon noodles, sesame oil, onion, mushrooms, zucchini, scallions, bean sprouts, basil, water or vegetable broth, tamari, pure maple syrup, garlic powder, red pepper flakes, sesame seeds///
1 package (9 – 12 oz.) udon noodles
1 tablespoon sesame oil
1 small onion, sliced
8 oz. mushrooms, sliced
1 large or 3 small zucchini, cut in half and sliced
3 – 4 scallions, cut into 1 inch pieces
large handful bean sprouts
handful of basil, whole leaf or roughly chopped
1/4 cup water or vegetable broth
3 tablespoons tamari, coconut amino’s or soy sauce
2 teaspoons pure maple syrup
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste
toasted sesame seeds, to garnish///

Cook noodles as directed on package, set aside.
While you’re waiting for the water to boil, begin slicing up your veggies.
In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat, add onion (not the scallions) and cook about 4 minutes or until onions soften. Add mushrooms and cook another 3 minutes. Add the zucchini, scallions, bean sprouts, basil, water/broth, tamari, maple syrup, garlic powder and red pepper flakes, cook another 3 – 4 minutes, or until zucchini has just softened. A cover will help cook your vegetables faster. Remove from heat, add noodles to the pan and toss together. You can also keep the noodles and vegetable mixture separate if you like and mix in your bowl.
Serve in individual bowls with a little of the juice from the bottom of the wok/pan. Top with toasted sesame seeds (and more red pepper flakes if you like). A little sriracha wouldn’t hurt either!
Serves 3
NOTES:
Add some cubed firm or extra-firm tofu for added protein.

ZUCCHINI & SWEET POTATO VICHYSSOISE///
olive oil, leeks, potatoes, zucchini, vegetable broth///
1 tablespoon olive oil or 1/4 cup water for water saute
5 cups leeks (about 2–3 large or 4–5 small), sliced
4 cups sweet potatoes (about 2 small), diced
3 cups zucchini (about 2 small), chopped
6 cups vegetable broth
mineral salt & fresh cracked pepper, to taste
2 teaspoons turmeric or curry powder, optional///

Chop and prepare your vegetables. For the leeks, once sliced place them in a bowl of cool water swishing them around to rinse away any dirt that is trapped, drain in a colander giving another good rinse, or simply use a colander making sure to break up the rings releasing any dirt in between. The sweet potatoes can either be peeled or left unpeeled.
In a large dutch oven or stockpot, heat oil over medium, add leeks, and saute until softened, about five minutes. Add the sweet potatoes, zucchini, vegetable broth, salt, pepper, and optional turmeric, bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Let cool for about 10 – 15 minutes. Using a handheld submersion blender, blend until creamy. Add the cream and blend again. Or you may opt to use a blender or food processor to blend your soup (this will most likely take two batches to complete).
Serve hot or chilled (I especially liked this warm or at room temp).

a few fresh basil leaves (left whole or chopped)
mineral salt + pepper, to taste
pinch of red pepper flakes, optional
3 cups cooked chickpeas or 2 cans (15 oz) garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed)///

Saute: In a heavy bottom pot or dutch oven, heat  olive oil over medium heat, add onions, garlic and bell peppers, saute for 3 – 4 minutes. Add tomatoes, mix well and cook 5 minutes.
Simmer (1): Add in eggplant, zucchini, herbs, spices, and season with salt and pepper. Reduce heat to a low and simmer uncovered for 15 minutes.
Simmer (2): Add in chickpeas, cover askew, and simmer anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on your personal preference (less time for firmer vegetables, more time for softer vegetables and more juices). Stir occasionally until ready.
Serve topped with chopped fresh herbs. Pair it with a gluten-free or favorite artisan loaf of bread. I have it here with a wonderful olive loaf. Try serving it on a bed of quinoa, farro, rice or pasta to make it go further.

CARROT + ZUCCHINI RIBBONS + CILANTRO PEPITA PESTO///
carrots, zucchini, pepitas, salt, almond parmesan///
3 large carrots
3 small zucchini
pepitas, for serving
mineral salt & cracked pepper to taste
almond parmesan, for serving

Cilantro Pepita Pesto (serves 4)

1 large bunch cilantro (3 cups loosely packed), ends removed, leaves and small stems ok
1/3 cup pepitas (shelled pumpkin seeds), toasted or raw
2 tablespoons hemp hearts, optional
2 cloves garlic
1 small jalapeno, seed removed (leave a few seeds for heat if you like)
3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
juice of 1 large lemon
1/2 teaspoon himilayan salt
1/2 teaspoon garam masala, optional///

Pesto: Place pepitas in your food processor and pulse a few times until seeds are broken down fairly well. Add remaining ingredients and blend until well combined and fairly smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, to thin if needed (no need to add more oil unless you want). Taste for flavor and season to taste. Set aside.
Ribbons: Peel the outer layer of your carrots and discard. Using the peeler, ribbon the carrots. Wash your zucchini, cut the ends off and using a mandolin, or tool of choice, ribbon the zucchini. You can just as well julienne your carrots and zucchini with a julienne tool or by hand if you would rather have thinner strands.
Combine: In a medium size bowl, place carrots and zucchini, add a few spoonfuls of pesto and mix to combine. You will have pesto leftover unless you really love the stuff and use it all!
Serve: Plate your ribbons, top with a sprinkle of pepitas and a nice dusting of almond parmesan. For a little extra color you could add some red pepper flakes to the top.
Serves 2
Store leftover pesto in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week. Use the pesto for pasta, as a dip for vegetables, as a spread for sandwiches, thin it out with water or lemon juice and make a dressing for salads, etc. Lots of ways to use pesto.
NOTES:
Use almonds in place of pepitas if needed. I used raw pepitas instead of toasting them.For the garam marsla, if pairing this with regular pasta I would leave it out. It pairs well with the freshness of the carrot & zucchini ribbons. Also, I found that it tasted fine with almond parmesan. But like I said earlier, I can eat some really unusual combinations. If you feel like experimenting, try it out…if in doubt, skip it.

Tofu egg: In a food processor/blender, combine the remaining ingredients and process until smooth. Taste for seasoning.
Assemble: Add the tofu mixture to the pan the vegetables cooked in and mix well. Spoon mixture into a lightly greased 9 inch round pie/quiche dish or springform pan. Level the top flat with the back of a spatula or spoon and make sure all edges are filled.

VEGAN BANANA BREAD (HEALTHY + EASY)///
spelt flour, pure cane sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, oil , or , vanilla extract, overripe bananas, almond milk, walnuts, chocolate chips, cinnamon///
1 3/4 cups (210 g) spelt flour (whole wheat, unbleached all-purpose, or gluten free blend), see notes
1/3 cup (75 g) organic pure cane sugar (or 1/2 finely chopped dates)
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
pinch of mineral salt
1/3 cup (75 ml) neutral flavored oil (or coconut oil in liquid state, vegan butter at room temp or applesauce
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
4 small or 3 large overripe bananas (about 1 1/2 – 1 3/4 cups (338-410g)), mashed
1/4 cup (56 ml) almond milk, use only if needed

optional tasty add-ins:

1/2 – 2/3 cup chopped walnuts
1/4 – 1/2 cup chocolate chips (mini or regular)
1 teaspoon cinnamon///

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease your loaf pan.
One bowl method: In a medium sized mixing bowl, mash 3 – 4 bananas (about 1 1/2 cups to 1 3/4 cups works well), add oil/applesauce and vanilla extract, mix again. Add the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder and salt, and mix well, but don’t overmix, just enough until the flour is combined. Batter will be slightly thick and a few lumps is ok. If mixture seems too thick, add milk, especially if using heavier flours such as whole wheat or whole spelt (you’re more inclined to need it).
Pour batter into a greased loaf pan. Bake for about 50 min – 1 hour. Ovens vary, mine usually takes 50 minutes. You can also do the toothpick test in the center of the loaf, if it comes out clean it should be ready. Remove from oven and let cool for 10 min before slicing.
